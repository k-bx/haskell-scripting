# Scripting in Haskell

Haskell is becoming more and more easy in terms of a language in which
you can write small programs that usually are launched from
command-line and do some helpful work.

This repository's goal is to become a one-stop shop serving
simultaneously a tutorial and a cookbook on how to write scripts in
Haskell, going from most simple and easy towards more complicated and
framework-heavy patterns.

TODO:

- [ ] prerequisites (install `stack`, run `stack setup`)
- [ ] tell about compiling script inside existing project `stack ghc ...`
- [ ] mention `stack` and `stack script`
- [ ] mention `ghcid`
- [ ] mention `OPTIONS_GHC -Wall -Werror`
- [ ] simple Prelude-only stdin/stdout
- [ ] `string-class` for the string madness
- [ ] reading inpfile, writing outfile
- [ ] additional recipes:
      - [ ] reading/writing json
      - [ ] reading/writing csv
      - [ ] parsing dates in weird format
      - [ ] making http api calls
- [ ] `optparse-applicative`
- [ ] `turtle` and its caching abilities, parsing (via sed)
